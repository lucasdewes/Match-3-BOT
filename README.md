This is a project from 2016 from mateusz sadowski found on youtube, linked to gitlab.

I updated the project and fixed some intermittent bugs.

Also modified the code so it could work on a quadHD monitor (2560 x 1440), specifically to work on the match 3 game (like candyCrush) there is in the Act3 of the current event Crownfall of Dota 2 https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/4178852863469164127
